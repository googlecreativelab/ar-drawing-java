# AR Drawing Started here
AR Drawing is an [AR Experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ar) written in Java using [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) that lets you draw simple white lines in 3d space by pressing your screen and moving the phone around the space. 

The code is based on the [ARCore example](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/hello_ar_java), the only large change is the LineRenderer. 

The experiment is an continuation of an [openFrameworks experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ar/arcore-drawing) made previously.

This is not an official Google product, but an [AR Experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ar) that was developed at Google Creative Lab. 

## Get started
To build the project, download it and open it in Android Studio 3.0. All dependencies should automatically be fetched by Android Studio. 

Before launching the app on your phone you have to install [ARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/download/sdk-preview/arcore-android-sdk-preview.zip) on it. 

You can check if your device is supported on [this list](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices)
