# AR Drawing
AR Drawing is an [AR Experiment](experiments.withgoogle.com/ar) written in Java using [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) that lets you draw simple white lines in 3d space by pressing your screen and moving the phone around the space. 

The code is based on the [ARCore example](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/java_arcore_hello_ar), the only large change is the LineRenderer. 

The experiment is an continuation of an [openFrameworks experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ar/arcore-drawing) made previously.

This is not an official Google product, but an [AR Experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ar) that was developed at Google Creative Lab. 

## Get started

Before launching the app on your phone you have to install [ARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/download/sdk-preview/arcore-android-sdk-preview.zip) on it.
